<h1>Swift Linux Help: Forensic</h1>

<BR><BR>
Here is the list of included
forensic/recovery/rescue programs with brief summaries of what they do.
(Source: Synaptic) For a more detailed explanation of what these
programs do, open a terminal and type "man (program)". Most of these
programs can only be run from the command line.
<br><br>Please note that many of these programs can only be run as
root, so you'll have to enter the "su" command and provide the root
password before you can proceed.
<br><br>

<h2>The Most Popular Forensic Programs</h2>

<h3>partimage</h3>
Partition Image is a partition imaging utility. It has support for the
following file systems:<br>
 * Ext2/3, the Linux standard<br>
 * ReiserFS, a journalised and powerful file system<br>
 * FAT16/32, DOS and Windows file systems<br>
 * HPFS, IBM OS/2 file system<br>
 * JFS, journalised file system, from IBM, used on AIX<br>
 * XFS, another journalised and efficient file system, from SGI, used on Irix<br>
 * UFS (beta), Unix file system<br>
 * HFS (beta), MacOS File system<br>
 * NTFS (experimental), Windows NT, 2000 and XP<br>
Only used blocks are copied and stored into an image file.
The image file can be compressed in the GZIP/BZIP2 formats to save disk space,
and split into multiple files to be copied onto removable media (ZIP for
example), burned on a CD-R, etc.

This makes it possible to save a full Linux/Windows system with a single
operation. In case of a problem (virus, crash, error, etc.), you just have
to restore, and after several minutes, your entire system is restored
(boot, files, etc.), and fully working.

This is very useful when installing the same software on many machines: just
install one of them, create an image, and restore the image on all other
machines.

<h3>recoverjpeg</h3>
Recoverjpeg tries to identify jpeg pictures from a filesystem image.
To achieve this goal, it scans the filesystem image and looks for a
jpeg structure at blocks starting at 512 bytes boundaries.

<h3>testdisk</h3>
TestDisk checks the partition and boot sectors of your disks.
 It is very useful in recovering lost partitions.
 It works with :<br>
 * DOS/Windows FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32<br>
 * NTFS ( Windows NT/2K/XP )<br>
 * Linux Ext2 and Ext3<br>
 * BeFS ( BeOS )<br>
 * BSD disklabel ( FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD )<br>
 * CramFS (Compressed File System)<br>
 * HFS and HFS+, Hierarchical File System<br>
 * JFS, IBM's Journaled File System<br>
 * Linux Raid<br>
 * Linux Swap (versions 1 and 2)<br>
 * LVM and LVM2, Linux Logical Volume Manager<br>
 * Netware NSS<br>
 * ReiserFS 3.5 and 3.6<br>
 * Sun Solaris i386 disklabel<br>
 * UFS and UFS2 (Sun/BSD/...)<br>
 * XFS, SGI's Journaled File System<br>
 <br><br>

<h2>Other Forensic Programs</h2>

<h3>chntpw</h3>
This little program provides a way to view information and
change user passwords in a Windows NT/2000 user database file.
Old passwords need not be known since they are overwritten.
In addition it also contains a simple registry editor
(same size data writes) and an hex-editor which enables you to
fiddle around with bits and bytes in the file as you wish.
<br><br>
If you want GNU/Linux boot disks for offline password recovery
you can add this utility to custom image disks or use those provided
at the tools homepage.

<h3>dares</h3>
Dares scans a CD/DVD image or a CD/DVD for files. This also works when
 the filesystem (ISO-9660 or UDF) on the disc is damaged and cannot be mounted
 anymore.
 
 <h3>dc3dd</h3>
  dc3dd is a patched version of GNU dd with added features for computer
 forensics:
<br>
  * on the fly hashing (md5, sha-1, sha-256, and sha-512)
  <br>
  * possibility to write errors to a file
  <br>
  * group errors in the error log
  <br>
  * pattern wiping
  <br>
  * progress report
  <br>
  * possiblity to split output

 
 <h3>dcfldd</h3>
  Based on the dd program with the following additional features:
 <br>
  - Hashing on-the-fly, dcfldd can hash the input data as it is being
    transferred, helping to ensure data integrity.
    <br>
  - Status output, dcfldd can update the user of its progress in terms of the
    amount of data transferred and how much longer operation will take.
    <br>
  - Flexible disk wipes, dcfldd can be used to wipe disks quickly and with a
    known pattern if desired.
    <br>
  - Image/wipe Verify, dcfldd can verify that a target drive is a bit-for-bit
    match of the specified input file or pattern.
    <br>
  - Multiple outputs, dcfldd can output to multiple files or disks at the same
    time.
    <br>
  - Split output, dcfldd can split output to multiple files with more
    configurability than the split command.
    <br>
  - Piped output and logs, dcfldd can send all its log data and output to
    commands as well as files natively.


<h3>ddrescue</h3>
dd_rescue is a tool to help you to save data from crashed partition.
It tries to read and if it fails, it will go on with the next sectors
where tools like dd will fail. If the copying process is interrupted
by the user it is possible to continue at any position later.
It can copy backwards.

<h3>e2undel</h3>
Interactive console tool to recover the data of deleted files on
 an ext2 file system under Linux. It does not require knowledge
 about how ext2 file systems works and should be usable by
 most people.
<br><br>
 This tools searches all inodes marked as deleted on a file system and
 lists them as sorted by owner and time of deletion. Additionally,
 it gives you the file size and tries to determine the file type in
 the way file(1) does. If you did not just delete a whole bunch of
 files with a 'rm -r *', this information should be helpful to find
 out which of the deleted files you would like to recover.
 <br><br>
 E2undel will not work on ext3 (journaling) filesystems.
 
<h3>ext3grep</h3>
 ext3grep is a simple tool intended to aid anyone who accidentally deletes a
 file on an ext3 filesystem, only to find that they wanted it shortly
 thereafter.

<h3>extundelete</h3>
extundelete uses the information stored in the partition's journal to attempt
 to recover a file that has been deleted. There is no guarantee that any
 particular file will be able to be undeleted.


<h3>foremost</h3>
 This is a console program to recover files based on their headers and footers
 for forensics purposes.
 <br><br>
 Foremost can work on disk image files, such as those generated by dd,
 Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers are
 specified by a configuration file, so you can pick and choose which headers
 you want to look for.


<h3>gddrescue</h3>
 The gddrescue tool copies data from one file or block device
 (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data
 in case of read errors.
 <br><br>
 gddrescue does not truncate the output file if not asked to.
 So, every time you run it on the same output file, it tries to
 fill in the gaps.
 <br><br>
 The basic operation of gddrescue is fully automatic.  That is,
 you don't have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the
 log, run it in reverse mode, etc.  If you use the logfile
 feature of gddrescue, the data is rescued very efficiently (only
 the needed blocks are read).  Also you can interrupt the rescue
 at any time and resume it later at the same point.
 <br><br>
 Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged
 copies of a file, cdrom, etc, and run gddrescue on all of them,
 one at a time, with the same output file, you will probably
 obtain a complete and error-free file. This is so because the
 probability of having damaged areas at the same places on
 different input files is very low. Using the logfile, only the
 needed blocks are read from the second and successive copies.
 <br><br>
 The logfile is periodically saved to disc. So in case of a crash
 you can resume the rescue with little recopying. Also, the same
 logfile can be used for multiple commands that copy different
 areas of the file, and for multiple recovery attempts over
 different subsets.
 <br><br>
 gddrescue aligns its I/O buffer to the sector size so that it
 can be used to read from raw devices. For efficiency reasons,
 also aligns it to the memory page size if page size is a
 multiple of sector size.
 <br><br>
 Please note that this is the GNU ddrescue version providing
 the /sbin/ddrescue executable. If you are searching for the
 ddrescue version of Kurt Garloff please check out the
 ddrescue package instead.
 
 <h3>gzrt</h3>
  gzrecover will attempt to skip over corrupted data in a gzip archive,
 thereby allowing the remaining data to be recovered.
 <br><br>
 Please install cpio to facilitate recovery from damaged gzipped tarballs.


<h3>magicrescue</h3>
 Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover
 and calls an external program to extract them. It looks at "magic bytes"
 in file contents, so it can be used both as an undelete utility and for
 recovering a corrupted drive or partition. As long as the file data is
 there, it will find it.
 
 <h3>myrescue</h3>
  myrescue is a program to rescue the still-readable data from a damaged
 harddisk. It is similar in purpose to dd_rescue, but it tries to quickly get
 out of damaged areas to first handle the not yet damaged part of the disk and
 return later.
 
 <h3>nasty</h3>
  Nasty is a program that helps you to recover the passphrase of your PGP or
 GPG-key in case you forget or lost it. The following features will make things
 easier:
 <br>
  - set minimum/maximun length of the passphrase
  <br>
  - incremental mode, random mode or reads a file for guessing
  <br>
  - charset filter


<h3>ngorca</h3>
 ngorca is a multithreaded password recovery tool using
 exhaustive key search for Oracle versions 7-11g Rel.2.
 Due to the weak hashing algorithm and constantly improving
 hardware performance, passwords can be found in minutes,
 depending on their length.


<h3>ophcrack</h3>
Ophcrack is a Windows password cracker based on a time-memory trade-off
using rainbow tables. This is a new variant of Hellman's original trade-off,
with better performance. It recovers 99.9% of alphanumeric passwords in
seconds.
<br><br>
It works for Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista.
<br><br>
A Gtk based UI is included.

<h3>ophcrack-cli</h3>
Ophcrack is a Windows password cracker based on a time-memory trade-off
using rainbow tables. This is a new variant of Hellman's original trade-off,
with better performance. It recovers 99.9% of alphanumeric passwords in
seconds.
<br><br>
It works for Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista.
<br><br>
This package contains ophcrack with command line interface only.

<h3>par2</h3>
 A command line implementation of the PAR v2.0 specification.  This
 specification is used for parity checking and repair of a file set.
 If the files in the recovery set ever get damaged (e.g. when they are
 transmitted or stored on a faulty disk) the client can read the damaged
 input files, read the (possibly damaged) PAR files, and regenerate the
 original input files. Of course, not all damages can be repaired, but
 many can.

<h3>pdfcrack</h3>
 pdfcrack is a simple tool for recovering passwords from pdf-documents.
 It should be able to handle all pdfs that uses the standard security handler
 but the pdf-parsing routines are a bit of a quick hack so you might stumble
 across some pdfs where the parser needs to be fixed to handle.
<br><br>
 pdfcrack allows configure the size of the searched password, use an
 external wordlist file and save cracking sessions to restore it later.

<h3>rdd</h3>
 A forensic copy program developed at and used by
 the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). Unlike most copy programs, rdd is
 robust with respect to read errors, which is an important property in a
 forensic operating environment.

<h3>recover</h3>
Recover automates some steps as described in the ext2-undeletion
howto. This means it seeks all the deleted inodes on your hard drive
with debugfs. When all the inodes are indexed, recover asks you some
questions about the deleted file. These questions are:<br>
  * Hard disk device name<br>
  * Year of deletion<br>
  * Month of deletion<br>
  * Weekday of deletion<br>
  * First/Last possible day of month<br>
  * Min/Max possible file size<br>
  * Min/Max possible deletion hour<br>
  * Min/Max possible deletion minute<br>
  * User ID of the deleted file<br>
  * A text string the file included (can be ignored)
<br><br>
If recover found any fitting inodes, it asks to give a directory name
and dumps the inodes into the directory. Finally it asks you if you
want to filter the inodes again (in case you typed some wrong
answers).
<br><br>
Note that recover works only with ext2 filesystems - it does not support
ext3.


<h3>recoverdm</h3>
This program will help you recover disks with bad sectors. You can recover
files as well complete devices. In case if finds sectors which simply cannot be
recoverd, it writes an empty sector to the outputfile and continues.
<br><br>
If you're recovering a CD or a DVD and the program cannot read the sector in
"normal mode", then the program will try to read the sector in "RAW mode"
(without error-checking etc.). This toolkit also has a utility called
'mergebad' which merges multiple images into one.

<h3>rephrase</h3>
 If you can nearly remember your GnuPG passphrase - but not quite - then
 Rephrase may be able to help. Tell Rephrase the parts of the passphrase you
 know, and any number of alternatives for the parts you're not sure about; and
 Rephrase will try all the alternatives, in all possible combinations, and tell
 you which combination (if any) gives you the correct passphrase.

<h3>rifiuti2</h3>
Rifiuti2 is a rewrite of rifiuti, a tool for analyzing Windows Recycle Bin
 INFO2 file.
<br><br>
 Analysis of Windows Recycle Bin is usually carried out during Windows computer
 forensics. Rifiuti2 can extract file deletion time, original path and size of
 deleted files and whether the deleted files have been moved out from the
 recycle bin since they are trashed. It supports the INFO2 file format found in
 Windows up to Window XP as well as the new file format found in Vista.


<h3>safecopy</h3> 
Safecopy is a data recovery tool which tries to extract as much data as
possible from a seekable, but problematic (i.e. damaged sectors) source - like
floppy drives, harddisk partitions, CDs, ..., where other tools like dd would
fail due to I/O errors.

<h3>scalpel</h3>
 A fast file carver that reads a database of header and footer definitions
 and extracts matching files from a set of image files or raw device files.
 Scalpel is filesystem-independent and will carve files from FATx, NTFS, ext2/3,
 or raw partitions. It is useful for both digital forensics investigation and
 file recovery.


<h3>scrounge-ntfs</h3>
Utility that can rescue data from corrupted NTFS partitions writes the files
retrieved to another working file system.


<h3>unhide </h3>

Unhide is a forensic tool to find processes and TCP/UDP ports hidden by
rootkits, Linux kernel modules or by other techniques.  It includes two
utilities: unhide and unhide-tcp.
<br><br>
unhide detects hidden processes using three techniques:<br>
 - comparing the output of /proc and /bin/ps<br>
 - comparing the information gathered from /bin/ps with the one gathered
   from system calls (syscall scanning)<br>
 - full scan of the process ID space (PIDs bruteforcing)
<br><br>
unhide-tcp identifies TCP/UDP ports that are listening but are not listed in
/bin/netstat through brute forcing of all TCP/UDP ports available.
<br><br>
This package can be used by rkhunter in its daily scans.


<h3>vdmfec</h3>
 VDMFEC implements Block ECC using a Forward Error Correction
 (FEC) code based on Vandermonde (VDM) matrices in GF(2^8) due
 to Luigi Rizzo. Given the FEC parameters K and N, with N
 greater than K, N blocks are written for every K input blocks
 in such a way that any K blocks are sufficient to reconstruct
 the data. That is, up to N - K blocks out of every group of N
 blocks may be lost without loss of data. Its primary
 application is intended to be in recovering data from
 unreliable media such as diskettes.
