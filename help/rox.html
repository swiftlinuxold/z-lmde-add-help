<H1>Swift Linux Help: ROX</H1>

<H2>What is ROX?</H2>
ROX is a desktop environment consisting of a file manager called ROX-Filer 
and a desktop background called ROX Pinboard.  ROX Pinboard provides
the clickable icons on the screen.

<H2>What is this other file manager I see, and why do the menu and 
desktop steer me towards it?</H2>
This other file manager is PCManFM.  PCManFM is smoother and more
polished than ROX-Filer but is still lightweight.  It has worked
successfully for years in antiX Linux and in the LXDE desktop
environment.

<H2>Can I add more clickable icons to the desktop?</H2>
Just open a PCManFM window and drag the files/folders to the desktop.
The resulting clickable icon will give you convenient 1-click access
to your desired files/folders.  To remove a clickble icon, move the
cursor over it, right-click, and select "remove item".

<H2>How do I change the desktop wallpaper?</H2>
Go to Control Center -> Wallpaper Wizard -> Desktop Wallpaper Wizard and
select your desired wallpaper file.
